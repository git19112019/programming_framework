## Description
The Universal Programming Learning Framework is a YAML-based tool designed to help learners grasp programming fundamentals across various languages. It provides:
- A structured approach to solving programming tasks.
- Pseudocode to define logic in a language-agnostic way.
- Examples implemented in multiple programming languages.
- Step-by-step guides and exercises for learners to practice and reinforce their skills.

## Features
### Pseudocode
This framework uses pseudocode to break down tasks logically, making it easier for beginners to understand programming concepts before translating them into code.

### Multi-Language Examples
Examples are provided in Python, JavaScript, Java, and C++ to help learners see how the same logic can be implemented differently based on the language.

### Flowchart Guidance
A simple flowchart illustrates the general workflow of a programming task:

- Understand requirements.
- Design the logic.
- Write code in the chosen language.
- Test, debug, and review.

  A[Start Task] --> B[Understand Requirements]
  B --> C[Design Logic]
  C --> D[Write Code in Chosen Language]
  D --> E[Test and Debug]
  E --> F{Task Completed?}
  F -- No --> D
  F -- Yes --> G[Review and Improve]
  G --> H[End]

### Programming Tasks
The framework includes exercises with clear objectives and pseudocode instructions, helping learners:
1. Practice input/output operations.
2. Understand arithmetic operations.
3. Explore loops and iterations.

### Language-Switch Rules
Guidance is included to adapt pseudocode into various programming languages, ensuring learners can pick their preferred language easily.

### Expandable Framework
Additional features like debugging tutorials, problem-solving strategies, and sample projects can be added for further learning.

## How to Use
1. **Explore the YAML File:** Understand the structure and navigate through the pseudocode, examples, and exercises.
2. **Start with Tasks:** Begin with the provided programming exercises and follow the pseudocode instructions.
3. **Pick a Language:** Use the multi-language examples as a reference to implement tasks in your chosen language.
4. **Follow the Flowchart:** Understand the overall workflow for solving programming problems effectively.
5. **Adapt and Expand:** Customize the framework by adding new examples, exercises, or features to suit your learning needs.
