## Description
The Universal Programming Learning Framework is a YAML-based structure designed to teach programming fundamentals in any language. It provides:
- Structured logic.
- Examples implemented in multiple programming languages.
- Step-by-step guides for learners to grasp core programming concepts.

## Features
### Pseudocode
Logical flow and language-agnostic representation of tasks:
1. **Setup**: Initialize environment, define requirements, and break down tasks.
2. **Core Logic**: Process input, perform operations, and handle edge cases.
3. **Output**: Display result or return a value gracefully.

### Examples
Explore how the same logic is implemented across different languages:
- Python:
    ```python
    def greet(name):
        return f"Hello, {name}!"
    print(greet("World"))
    ```
- JavaScript:
    ```javascript
    function greet(name) {
        return `Hello, ${name}!`;
    }
    console.log(greet("World"));
    ```
- Java:
    ```java
    public class HelloWorld {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println(greet("World"));
        }
        public static String greet(String name) {
            return "Hello, " + name + "!";
        }
    }
    ```
- C++:
    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
    string greet(string name) {
        return "Hello, " + name + "!";
    }
    int main() {
        cout << greet("World") << endl;
        return 0;
    }
    ```

### Flowchart
Visual representation of a beginner's task flow:

### Tasks
Programming exercises for learners:
1. **Basic Input and Output**: Greet users based on their name.
2. **Basic Arithmetic**: Add two numbers entered by the user.
3. **Loop Example**: Print numbers from 1 to 10 using a loop.

### Language Switch
Guidance for adapting pseudocode into specific languages:
- **Python**: Use indentation for blocks.
- **JavaScript**: Use braces `{}` and semicolons.
- **Java**: Explicit types and classes.
- **C++**: Include directives and define `main`.

### Additional Features
Consider extending this framework with:
- Debugging tutorials for various languages.
- Problem-solving strategies, like divide-and-conquer.
- Sample projects for applying learned concepts.
