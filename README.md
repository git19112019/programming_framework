## Description
The Universal Programming Learning Framework is a YAML-based tool designed to help learners grasp programming fundamentals across various languages. It provides:
- A structured approach to solving programming tasks.
- Pseudocode to define logic in a language-agnostic way.
- Examples implemented in multiple programming languages.
- Step-by-step guides and exercises for learners to practice and reinforce their skills.

## Features
### Pseudocode
This framework uses pseudocode to break down tasks logically, making it easier for beginners to understand programming concepts before translating them into code.

### Multi-Language Examples
Examples are provided in Python, JavaScript, Java, and C++ to help learners see how the same logic can be implemented differently based on the language.

### Flowchart Guidance
A simple flowchart illustrates the general workflow of a programming task:

  A[Start Task] --> B[Understand Requirements]
  B --> C[Design Logic]
  C --> D[Write Code in Chosen Language]
  D --> E[Test and Debug]
  E --> F{Task Completed?}
  F -- No --> D
  F -- Yes --> G[Review and Improve]
  G --> H[End]
